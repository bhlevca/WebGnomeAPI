Both **Temperature** and **Salinity** are needed to determine the density of seawater. Density is a major factor in determining whether an oil will float or sink.  

**Sediment Load** can also affect the behavior of an oil slick. Sedimentation is the sorption of oil to suspended sediments that eventually settle out of the water column and accumulate on the seafloor. 

**Wave Height** is used to calculate wave energy and to estimate the rate of dispersion of oil from the surface slick into the water column. You can either have the wave climate computed from the wind speed or specify a wave height. When calculating wave height from the wind speed, you can also specify the the horizontal distance over which wave-generating winds blow, known as the **Fetch**. GNOME defaults to unlimited fetch -- if you specify a fetch, it will limit the wave energy, and thus result in reduced dispersion rates.
