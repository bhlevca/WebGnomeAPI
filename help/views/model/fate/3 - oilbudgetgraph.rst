Oil Budget - Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab helps to visualize the data from the Oil Budget - Table tab. The pie chart at the top shows the amount of oil that is dispersed, floating, sedimented, evaporated, off maps, beached, chemically dispersed, boomed, burned, skimmed and floating depending on the options you chose in Setup View.  

The graph displays this data over time. Hover your mouse over the graph and the pie chart will adjust to show the exact amounts for that time. Hovering your mouse over the graph will also cause the amount of floating, evaporated, natural dispersion, and beached to appear for that point on the graph. 

For longer duration spills, this graph may take some time to load. If labels on the pie charts are difficult to see, please refer to the graph below or to the Oil Budget - Table tab.
