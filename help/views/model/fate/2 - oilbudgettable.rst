Oil Budget - Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Oil Budget Table shows the results of your model run showing the amount of oil that is dispersed, floating, sedimented, evaporated, off maps, beached, chemically dispersed, boomed, burned, skimmed and floating (depending on the options you chose in Setup View). This table is produced as the model is evaluated, and so may take up to several minutes to finish loading. The table can be sorted by hour or date using the drop-down menu under Time Column Display at the top. You can change the units displayed using the drop-down menu under Time Column Display at the top. You also have the option of having the table sort by the release amount, percent, or fraction.
