Fate View
^^^^^^^^^^
 
This view shows how the volume of the oil on the water surface changes over time due to weathering processes (evaporation, dispersion etc.) It also displays how the oil properties change over time due to these same processes. The view has four tabs: Oil Budget - Table, Oil Budget - Graph, Weathering, and ICS209. 

You may edit you model at any time by switching back to Setup View via the menu buttons on the right.


Export Options
==============

As you switch between tabs (graphs, tables) the export options are context sensitive (i.e. what is exported will change depending on what data you are viewing).

To export into a spreadsheet, click on the CSV (comma-separated values) option. This file can then be imported into your spreadsheet.

To copy the information into a document such as Microsoft word, click on the html option. Highlight the text or data that you want to copy and then paste it into your document.

Information can also be saved as an image (PNG) or printed.
