About Panama Canal Atlantic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Panama Canal - Atlantic location file covers the area outside the Panama Canal entrances on the Atlantic side of the canal system (on the northern coast of Panama). The area covered is from the ocean sides of the Agua Clara and Gatun locks on the south, Limon Bay and the dock areas of Colón, and the area of the Caribbean just outside the entrance to the Bay.

This location file is one of three location files covering Panama - the others model the Pacific entrance and approach, and Lake Gatun and the passages inside the canals.


Background
=============================================

The location file is designed to simulate oil spills in the area. Oil spill risk is mainly from the large amount of vessel traffic navigating through the Panama Canal, making this location important  for response and response planning. 
The location file will predict transport using two current patterns designed to represent observed currents in the area.  The first pattern represents flow inside Limon Bay set up by wind forcing. The second is an offshore pattern driven by the predominantly west to east currents offshore of Colón in the Caribbean Sea.
The Panama - Atlantic location file does not include a tidal current pattern due to the low tidal forcing. Resultant tidal velocities would not result in significant transport of oil during a spill.
